# AI-Vtuber Yuri
<pre>
We are students from The Chinese University of Hong Kong.
This is a final year project for Computer Science and Engineering. 
This project used Unity and Live2D cubism to manage the Vtuber model, and Python to control the AI.
The AI used the model gpt-3.5-turbo with a fine-tuned openAI Key.
We made all the Art and Live2D models, please use free Live2D resources if you use our project.
